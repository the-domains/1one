  Instush is an interesting site. Very simple to setup, you simply need to
  authorize the app with your Instagram account, and they have various free
  galleries that you can use. I’m not sure what is meant to happen if you click
  on a photo, as you can see it errors if you try.

[Instush][0] is an interesting site. Very simple to setup, you simply need to authorize the app with your Instagram account, and they have various free galleries that you can use. I'm not sure what is meant to happen if you click on a photo, as you can see it errors if you try.

It also seems to be cycling through the last 20 photos in your gallery, which is pretty cool.
